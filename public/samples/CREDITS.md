If jsDelivr refuses a file, the app falls back to raw.githubusercontent.com at the same commit.

Instruments used: acoustic_grand_piano, electric_piano_1, electric_bass_finger, string_ensemble_1, acoustic_guitar_nylon, flute, clarinet.
There is one sample every 4 semitones per instrument, so playback pitch shift is at most ±2 semitones. The engine refuses anything beyond ±4.
